        q: "Do cash advance apps check your credit?",
        a: "No. None of the apps on this list run a hard credit check to qualify you for an advance. Eligibility is based on your bank account activity and direct deposit history — not your FICO score. Possible Finance does a soft pull for its installment loan product, which does not affect your score.",
      },
      {
        q: "Are cash advance apps safe?",
        a: "Yes. All seven apps use Plaid or similar bank-grade encryption to link your account — the same infrastructure used by Venmo, Robinhood, and most major fintechs. Your banking credentials are never stored inside the cash advance app itself.",
      },
      {
        q: "How is this different from a payday loan?",
        a: "Cash advance apps charge no interest and no mandatory fees — just optional tips, small subscriptions ($1–$15/month), or express-transfer fees. Traditional payday loans charge 300–500% APR. Even the highest-fee app on this list costs dramatically less than a storefront payday loan.",
      },
      {
        q: "Will a cash advance app hurt my credit score?",
        a: "No. Standard cash advance apps (EarnIn, Dave, Brigit, Albert, Chime MyPay, Tilt) do not report to credit bureaus at all, so they cannot help or hurt your score. Possible Finance does report — on-time payments build credit, missed payments can damage it.",
      },
      {
        q: "How fast can I get the money?",
        a: "Standard transfers are free and take 1–3 business days. Instant transfers arrive in minutes for a small fee (typically $1.99–$8.99 depending on the app and advance amount). Chime MyPay stands out with free standard transfer for Chime Checking customers.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I use more than one cash advance app at once?",
        a: "Technically yes, but it is a red flag. Most apps monitor for this and will lower your limits or close your account. If you need multiple apps to cover regular expenses, the real problem is a budgeting or income issue that more debt will not solve.",
      },
      {
        q: "What happens if I cannot repay on payday?",
        a: "Apps will automatically attempt to debit the advance plus any fees from your linked bank account on your next payday. If the debit fails, you may face overdraft fees from your bank. Apps like EarnIn and Dave offer repayment extensions — reach out to support before your due date if you know you cannot repay.",

Acorns is great for automatic investing but charges $3 to $12/month, which eats into small portfolios. Stash has similar fee issues.

        a: "Yes. All five apps are SIPC-insured up to $500,000 per account ($250,000 cash). Fidelity and Schwab are also members of major banking and clearing systems with additional private insurance. Your investments are held in segregated accounts separate from the broker's own assets.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I have multiple investing apps at the same time?",
        a: "Absolutely. There is no penalty for having brokerage accounts at multiple firms, and many investors split between a long-term broker (Fidelity, Schwab) and an active trading platform (Webull, Robinhood). The IRS treats them all the same for tax purposes.",

      {
        q: "What is a cash sweep and why does it matter?",
        a: "A cash sweep automatically moves your uninvested cash into a money market fund or partner bank that earns interest. In 2026, top sweep rates are 4–5%, while bottom-tier brokers pay 0.01%. On a $50,000 cash balance, that difference is $2,500/year — real money for doing nothing.",
      },
      {
        q: "Should I choose an app based on the sign-up bonus?",
        a: "Bonuses are nice but should not be the primary factor. A $1,000 bonus is irrelevant if the platform's ongoing fees, weak research, or poor execution cost you $5,000 over 5 years. Pick the app that fits your investing style first, then take the bonus if available.",
      },
      {
        q: "Do these apps offer Roth IRAs?",
        a: "All five apps offer Roth IRAs. Robinhood, SoFi, Fidelity, and Schwab all support Traditional, Roth, and SEP IRAs. Webull offers Traditional and Roth IRAs as of 2025.",

        q: "What is the minimum to start investing?",

          "Fees — passive index ETFs and index mutual funds both run 0.00%-0.10%; active mutual funds average 0.5%-1.0%.",
          "Taxes — ETFs use an 'in-kind' creation/redemption process that almost never triggers capital gains. Mutual funds pass annual capital gains to all shareholders.",
          "Auto-invest — Mutual funds let you DCA an exact dollar amount monthly. ETFs require fractional-share support (Fidelity, Schwab, Robinhood do; Vanguard does not).",

        heading: "Tax Efficiency — Why ETFs Win in Taxable Accounts",
        paragraphs: [
          "This is the single biggest reason advisors recommend ETFs for taxable brokerage accounts. When a mutual fund manager sells holdings to meet redemptions or rebalance, every shareholder gets a 1099-DIV at year-end with their share of the capital gain — even if you never sold a share. ETFs avoid this through in-kind redemptions, so you only pay tax when YOU sell.",
          "In tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA, Roth IRA), this difference does not matter — gains compound tax-free either way. That's why mutual funds remain popular in retirement plans.",

          "401(k) or IRA → either works; pick whatever your plan offers cheapest",
          "Want to DCA exact dollar amounts → Mutual fund OR ETF at a fractional-share broker",

          body: "Over 20-year periods, roughly 85-90% of actively managed mutual funds underperform a simple S&P 500 index fund — and the few that win are nearly impossible to identify in advance. For most investors, a low-cost index ETF or index mutual fund is the right answer.",

      {
        q: "Do ETFs have hidden costs mutual funds don't?",
        a: "ETFs have a bid-ask spread (usually fractions of a cent on liquid funds like VOO). For long-term holders this is negligible. Day-traders should stick to high-volume ETFs to keep spreads tight.",

        q: "What's the deal with Fidelity ZERO funds?",
        a: "FZROX, FZILX, etc. charge a 0.00% expense ratio but only exist inside Fidelity accounts — you can't transfer them to another broker. Great for IRAs you'll never move; risky if you might switch brokerages.",
      },
      {
        q: "Should I ever pick an active mutual fund?",
        a: "Rarely. The data is brutal: most underperform after fees. If you go active, keep it under 10% of your portfolio and only in areas where active management has historically added value (small-cap, emerging markets).",
